Gabriel Burca:
- Fixed Bible text encoding for all(?) Sword modules (only tested with RomCor which is encoded in UTF8).
- Fixed the Lister library to eliminate some errors where the index was out of range and caused errors in the MainForm.cs design.
- Added BibleText tab for fast bible text searches.

TODO:
- Allow the user to select the desired Diatheke locale so that the bible book names show up in the desired language.
- Consider changing FileTypes/Config.cs to use System.Configuration.ConfigurationSettings as in:
	http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Code/2002/April/XMLConfigInWinForms.asp

Notes:
- The Diatheke provided regex search is practically unusable because all orthographic marks must be accounted for
- The DataGrid and Lister controls are not usable for fast RegEx searches because the matched expressions can not be highlighted.
- The RichTextBox control is not as slow if the whole bible text is added at once (instead of verse by verse)
