Gabriel Burca:
- Added Theme handling
- Vista compatibility. User created files are now saved in the DataDirectory
  and the installer has been updated to deal with UAC. Thanks to Danny Baies
  for helping with the installer portion and for testing it.
- Improved word-break when displaying Bible verses. In the past, the word-break
  (line wrap) was left up to the .NET framework which did not handle things
  properly. This version uses a custom line wrap algorithm which only breaks
  lines at spaces. In the future this can be expanded to handle hyphenation.
- Added separate theme setting/entry for the key and author data in a song.
- Improved string folding (the ability to remove diacritics from text for
  easier search).
- Improved multimedia controls.
- Fixed a number of threading issues where non-UI threads were modifying UI
  controls
- Fixed localization code so it falls back to English if a translation item for
  the selected language is not available
- Added consistent handling of file/path locations
- Removed dependency on OPaC which was not re-painting labels properly anymore
  (maybe due to .NET 2.0)
- Added the source code for LEDRadioButton and fixed it so it works properly
  with the visual designer
- Upgraded project to VS C# 2005
- Massive code clean-up and reorganization, including:
	o All BibleText controls were moved out of MainForm.cs into BibleText.cs
	o All designer code was removed from MainForm.cs
	o A lot of dead code and files were removed
- Many bug fixes. Many thanks to the following testers that reported bugs in the
  pre-release version:
	* Sergiu Burca
	* Stefan Kaufmann
	* Jari Strand
	* Danny Baies

Gabriel Burca:
- Fixed Bible text encoding for all(?) Sword modules (only tested with RomCor which is encoded in UTF8).
- Fixed the Lister library to eliminate some errors where the index was out of range and caused errors in the MainForm.cs design.
- Added BibleText tab for fast bible text searches.

TODO:
- Allow the user to select the desired Diatheke locale so that the bible book names show up in the desired language.
- Consider changing FileTypes/Config.cs to use System.Configuration.ConfigurationSettings as in:
	http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Code/2002/April/XMLConfigInWinForms.asp

Notes:
- The Diatheke provided regex search is practically unusable because all orthographic marks must be accounted for
- The DataGrid and Lister controls are not usable for fast RegEx searches because the matched expressions can not be highlighted.
- The RichTextBox control is not as slow if the whole bible text is added at once (instead of verse by verse)
